# CARBON-EMISSIONS-
Edunet IBM Skills Build project

The project began by loading a climate change dataset from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. An initial exploration was performed to understand the structure of the dataset, including column names, data types, and the nature of values in specific fields. It was observed that the `SCALE` column contained non-numeric entries such as "Thousands" and "Units", which were not suitable for numerical analysis. These rows were filtered out to maintain consistency in the dataset. Unnecessary columns like `Country name`, `Series code`, `SCALE`, and `Decimals` were also dropped to simplify the dataset and focus on relevant information. Additionally, placeholder values like `'..'` and empty strings were replaced with proper `NaN` values to ensure accurate handling of missing data. As a result of these cleaning steps, the dataset was reduced from 13,512 rows to 10,017 rows and from 28 columns to 24 columns. The cleaned dataset is now well-prepared for further data analysis or modeling tasks.
